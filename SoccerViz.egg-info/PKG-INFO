Scrape event data from **[WhoScored](whoscored.com)** **_ONLY_** inorder to use it for data analysis and visualization, you would have to fill in the following parameters according to
your liking, below example is given follow it and keep in mind the instructions given too with the code.
    
    
    #This is an example URL from Whoscored.com similar to the below one
    
    url = 'https://www.whoscored.com/Matches/1729462/Live/England-Premier-League-2023-2024-Arsenal-Liverpool'  #This is an example URL from Whoscored.com
    url_shots = 'https://api.sofascore.com/api/v1/event/11352376/shotmap'  
    #This^ is taken from the Sofascore API you can do the same by watching Mckay Johns Tutorial on how to fetch API of shotmaps from Sofascore.

    #Put your USER AGENT in the HEADERS parameter, you can find yours on "https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-http-headers-is-my-browser-sending"
    
    HEADERS = {
            'User-Agent': "#your user agent"
        }

    headers_shots = { 'Accept': '*/*',
    'Sec-Fetch-Site': 'same-site',
    'Accept-Language': 'en-GB,en;q=0.9',
    # 'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip, deflate, br',
    'Sec-Fetch-Mode': 'cors',
    'Cache-Control': 'max-age=0',
    'Origin': 'https://www.sofascore.com',
    'User-Agent': "same user agent used in normal Headers", 
    'Connection': 'keep-alive',
    'Referer': 'https://www.sofascore.com/',
    'Host': 'api.sofascore.com',
    'Sec-Fetch-Dest': 'empty',
      }   

    shots = requests.get(url_shots, headers=headers_shots)

    #Call the extract functions to get Pass Dataframe,Players Dataframe of the particular match
    
    
    df = extract.pass_data(url,HEADERS)
    players_df = extract.player_data(url,HEADERS)
    
    #You can find the TEAM Id's of the clubs on their WhoScored page html tags by clicking on the club logos
    
    home_team_id=13 #Arsenal Team ID
    away_team_id=26 #Liverpool Team ID

Download the EPL Club data excel file which is present in the repository and assign df_clubs to the file location

    df_clubs = pd.read_excel('#file_local_location')

After scrapping the event data and assembling into DataFrames, you will need to filter the data according to the teams and players.

    #Filter all the data according to the teams by calling the function into DataFrames(their names are pretty self explanatory)

    #You can use and call any dataframe you would like to analyze in raw tables and columns i.e. in a DataFrame form
    pass_between_home, pass_between_away, avg_loc_home, avg_loc_away, passes_home, passes_away,df_prg_home,df_comp_prg_home,df_uncomp_prg_home,df_prg_away,df_comp_prg_away,df_uncomp_prg_away = datafilter.analyze_passes(df, players_df, home_team_id, away_team_id)

    #Same goes for the shots of the match
    df1_missed,df2_missed,df1_saved,df2_saved,df1_goal,df2_goal,df1_block,df2_block,totalxG1,totalxG2=datafilter.analyze_shots(shots)


Now finally, you can plot the pass network map for both the teams to analyze and visualize by calling the function

    #Call the function and manually put in the home and away team names
    
    plot = plot.pass_network(pass_between_home, pass_between_away, avg_loc_home,avg_loc_away,hometeam_name,awayteam_name)

Plotting Prg Passes
    
    #Call the function and put in home and away team names
    plot = plot.prg_passes(df_comp_prg_home, df_uncomp_prg_home, df_comp_prg_away, df_uncomp_prg_away, hometeam_name,
                    awayteam_name)
![test.png](SoccerViz%2Ftest.png)

Plotting Shot Maps
    
    #Call the function 
    plot = plot.shot_map(df1_missed, df2_missed, df1_saved, df2_saved, df1_goal, df2_goal, df1_block, df2_block, home_team_id,
                 away_team_id, df_clubs, totalxG1, totalxG2)
